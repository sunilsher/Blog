      <p><b><h3>HISTORY OF GAMING INDUSTRY</h3></b>
        The gaming industry has undergone a substantial evolution since the 1970s and has moved from a fringe activity into the mainstream. In 1971, the arcade game Computer Space was released and was followed up by Atari Incâ€™s first commercially successful video game, Pong. Games entered the home formally with the release of an early gaming console called the Magnavox Odyssey. The market lost momentum in 1977 and was rejuvenated in 1978 by another successful game called Space invaders. With this, arcade machines began to appear in mainstream public spaces such as malls, stores and restaurants. Space invaders went on to make $2 billion in 1982. In the late 1970s, personal computer gaming also took off and the development of computing led to a simultaneous advancement in gaming technology as well.

        The industry saw another crash in 1983, down from a successful period in the early 1980s. 1982 saw the peak of the industry with a revenue of $8 billion which overtook annual revenues or pop music and Hollywood films combined. The crash was brought about in North America because of too many substandard games. The Nintendo Entertainment System revived the industry once again. By the late 1980s, handheld systems such as Gameboy were also entering the market

        During the 1990s, some important advancements were made in the industry including the use of CDs to store and distribute software as well as the large-scale implementation of GUI-based operation systems. Along with this, there were advancements in 3D graphics and these became the standard for video game visuals. The processing speeds and sophistication for computers also continued to develop and the size of hardware reduced significantly to herald the advancement of mobile gaming. The popularity of the internet allowed multiplayer games and competitive gaming. The industry continued to generate substantial revenues such as in 1994 an estimated $7 billion from arcades and $ 6 billion from home consoles in the US alone, which was close to 2.5 times the revenue generated by films in the country during the same time period.

        The industry remained unpredictable in the 2000s as third party game developers game and went quickly. Some managed to stay on such as casual and indie games, Braid and Limbo. Mobile phone games began to be developed for iOS and Android devices and a new gaming platform emerged in the form of social media sites. Following 2010, the industry continues to develop and profit drives technological advancement which then benefits other sectors of the industry. Casual and Indie games continue to have a presence and there continues to be development in PC, console and mobile gaming.</p>
